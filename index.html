                  <h2>A little bit about me.</h2>
    <div class="half-width">
      <p>I've made my home base in Southport, North Carolina, with my three                 beautiful daughters.  My journey into tech started at a very young age.            From the very first time I got to play (a game) on my moms old IBM PC I          was spellbound, and since then the continuing advancements in tech has          held my interest over the years.  It has always been something that I          have wanted to be a part of in any and every way posible.  It's amazing          to me how quickly things went from DOS games to such a large marjority of          people/businesses having their own personal website('s). How it has          become almost a necesity to make your presence known on the web to get          your name, your company, your ideas/designs/creations YOUR VOICE out          there for the entire world to see and hear.  
       </p>
    </div>
    <div class="half-width">
      <p>That curiosity then opened a door that could never be shut. When I
        learned how to build my first website, 

        I was hooked and wanted to learn how to build my own site to fit my own         specific needs.
	
	It amazed me how easy it became to make your presence known on the web and         how with alittle hard work, some great design ideas, and creativity any         individual could get their voice and ideas out there for the entire world         to see and hear or at very least the select communities or groups of         people that one may choose.



        I realized I found something
        that gave me the freedom & versatility I was looking for in my work.
        Now I've made a full switch to front-end development, where I can use
        my organization skills and eye for detail to write clean, elegant code.

                    <h3>Hand-Coded HTML</h3>
                    <p>My focus is writing clean, well-formatted, semantic
                      HTML5 by hand to make sure that the content is easy to
                      read, easy to collaborate, trouble-shoot and accessible.

                      <h3>Well-Organized CSS</h3>
                      <p>I pride myself on writing CSS that is easy to read
                        and build on. I focus on keeping my CSS lean and fast
                        to load, and I make it a habit to stay up to date on
                         current best practices.</p>

                        <p>You can trust me to take a designer's PSD and
                          quickly & accurately convert it into a webpage that
                          is pixel-perfect match.</p>
